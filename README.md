# TSID (Time-Sorted ID)

Implementation of TSID based on Snowflake ID.

## What is TSID?

TSID (stands for Time-Sorted ID) is a special type of ID that looks like UUID but is actually sortable and incremental.
This ensures the usage of indexing in the database while preserving the uniqueness of UUID (or mostly the look of it).

TSID is basically a signed 64-bit integer (long in Java). The implementation is heavily inspired by the following
sources:

- Vlad Mihalcea's posts on [TSID](https://vladmihalcea.com/tsid-identifier-jpa-hibernate/)
  and [why using it at all](https://vladmihalcea.com/uuid-database-primary-key).
- [Snowflake ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowflake_ID) from X (formerly Twitter).

## Implementation Details

The current implementation of TSID consists of three parts:

- The first 42 bits represent the timestamp of the creation of the TSID. Specifically, it comprises a 1-bit signed value
  and a 41-bit timestamp. The timestamp is calculated by getting the current UTC in milliseconds since Unix epoch and
  subtracting the custom epoch value (if defined).
- The next 10 bits represent the node ID for the current machine/node/worker. This allocation is particularly useful in
  systems where multiple instances of applications are deployed, and each utilizes the TsidFactory for generating the
  Tsid.
- Finally, the last 12 bits represent an incremental sequence number for multiple TSIDs generated within the same
  millisecond (timestamp), if such occurrences arise. The starting sequence for each timestamp is securely randomized to
  minimize the predictability of the TSID.

## Usage

To generate an instance of `Tsid`, we use `TsidFactory`:

```java
import com.vincentdao.tsid.Tsid;
import com.vincentdao.tsid.TsidFactory;

public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Quickly generate a new one (NOT THREAD-SAFE!)
    Tsid quickGeneratedTsid = TsidFactory.instance().quickGenerate();

    // Generate new Tsid (thread-safe)
    Tsid tsid = TsidFactory.instance().generate();

    // Reset the factory
    TsidFactory.reset();

    // Configure the factory using its Builder
    TsidFactory.builder()
            .withNode()
            .customizedAs(69L)
            .withEpoch()
            .customizedAs(1000000L)
            .build();

    // Now, the new Tsid will have its node set to 69 and timestamp calculated from epoch 1000000
    Tsid configuredTsid = TsidFactory.instance().generate();
}
```

If we already have a `Tsid` value (`long` or `String`), we can use `Tsid` static methods:

```java
import com.vincentdao.tsid.Tsid;

public static void main(String[] args) {
    // The value must be 64-bit integer!
    Tsid fromLongTsid = Tsid.fromLong(1541815603606036480L);

    // String must be in Crockford's encoding
    Tsid fromStringTsid = Tsid.fromString("2NJT27V22YG00");
}
```

## Configure the factory

There are currently two configurations for the factory:

- Node ID: Indicates the current machine/node/worker. As TSIDs can be generated by multiple instances in the system, it
  is crucial to clearly define each node with its ID to ensure safe generation (i.e., no collision). The default value
  is the current thread's ID where the call to obtain the factory instance occurs.
- Custom epoch: Specifies the epoch for calculating the timestamp. The default is the Unix epoch.

These values can be defined at 3 places: system's environment, system's properties (for current running Java app), and
on code-level using `TsidFactory.Builder`.

Configuring for the properties is used through `-D` argument:

```
java -D
```

Here are the name of these variables:

- Node:
    - `TSID_NODE` for `env`
    - `tsid.node` for `property`
- Epoch:
    - `TSID_EPOCH` for `env`
    - `tsid.epoch` for `property`

## String Representation

The String representation of TSID is based on [Crockford's Base32](https://www.crockford.com/base32.html):

```java
import com.vincentdao.tsid.Tsid;
import com.vincentdao.tsid.TsidFactory;

public static void main(String[] args) {
  // Example for Tsid with value "1541815603606036480"
  Tsid id = TsidFactory.instance().generate();

  System.out.println(id.asLong());                  // 1541815603606036480
  System.out.println(id.asString());                // "2NJT27V22YG00"
  System.out.println(id);                           // "2NJT27V22YG00"
  System.out.println(id.asLowercaseString());       // "2njt27v22yg00"
}
```
